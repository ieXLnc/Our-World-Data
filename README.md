# Our-World-Data Visualisations

This website was made as a portfolio project to learn dash and plotly and demonstrate my skills in both.

To create a relevant visualization website, I drew a lot of inspiration from the [In our world data](https://ourworldindata.org/) website, where most of the datasets I used in this project came from.

The goal of this project was to create my own visualizations, learn how to code them in backend and frontend and deploy them. 
I don't think I could have picked a better example than the ourworldindata.org site, their visualizations are relevant, well thought out and super explanatory.

This is the first version with a basic visual that will improve over time. 

For now there are 5 pages: 
- Home page
- CO2 emissions of countries
- Gender equality visualisations
- Democracy visualisations
- The last page allows you to select a specific country and have all the data for the selected country.

I will also try to add new pages as I go along!

You can find the web application [here](https://ourworldvisualisation.herokuapp.com/)<br>
And the docker container at: iexlnc/dashboard_deployement

New version & detailled description coming soon!

Next steps are: 
- Creating a Database with all datasets to get my data from SQL instead of static pandas files
- Improve backend visu and frontend comprehension based on feedbacks!
